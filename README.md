# PozRezLSL
 A relative position rezzing system for Second Life
 
 
Creators Setup:-

1. Place all of the items you wish to rez as well as the item that will be rezzing them.  All items should have different names, if you have the same item but in two positions just rename them "item name 1", "item name 2" etc.

2. Position the items where you want them to be rezzed..

3. Place the PosRez - Creator script in the root prim of the item that will be rezzing the items.

4. Put the scripts from the  "PosRez 1.4 Place in object to be rezzed" folder in all of the objects that will be rezzed. Set the permissions accordingly: NB scripts must be copy/ no transfer. Items to be rezzed must also be copy. 

5. Click on your rezzer and from the menu select "set".

6. Pick up all of the objects and drag them into the contents tab of your rezzer. Add as many objects as you deem sensible.  You can test this now by clicking the rezzer and choosing rez.

7. Replace the PosRez creator script with the PosRez Customer script. Then set permissions accordingly, I strongly suggest copy / no transfer. 

 

 A note:

 Name your item what you want it to say on the button. If it is named 'Object', your button will say Object. 

Do not name any objects with the following names:
 
"--->"
"<---"
"Exit Menu"
"OPTIONS"
 "request"

You probably wouldn't anyway but you never know with some people.

End user instructions:-

1. Click the item

2. Choose which object to rez or click options which lets you rez all the things or close the dialog box, you can also just press ignore to close the dialog. 

3. Click the rezzed item and select to either remove scripts or delete the object.

A note:

Rezzing the same object again will  delete the previously rezzed item if it is in the same position. If you want to rez two of something simply rez the object, move it and then rez another from the menu.
